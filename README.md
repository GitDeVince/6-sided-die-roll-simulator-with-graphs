# 6-sided-die-roll-simulator-with-graphs

Earlier, I read a part of a statistics and probability book about probability distribution and the 6-sided die. Since I got time, I practiced doing this small project into python.
This program just repeating the die roll based on how many attempts the user wants to do. Then after finishing the attempts, it will show the result of how many times it landed to 1, then 2, and so on and so forth.
After that, it will put into a function that makes those results into a bar graph that shows the results in visual. Do note that every new use will change the look of answser.

Example of the result of 500 attempts in a bar graph.
